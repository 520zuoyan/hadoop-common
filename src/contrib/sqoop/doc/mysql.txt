Fast MySQL Imports
------------------

While the JDBC-based import method used by Sqoop provides it with the
ability to read from a variety of databases using a generic driver, it
is not the most high-performance method available. Sqoop can read from
a local MySQL database considerably faster by using the +mysqldump+ tool
distributed with MySQL. If you run Sqoop on the same machine where a
MySQL database is present, you can take advantage of this faster
import method by running Sqoop with the +--direct+ argument. This
combined with a connect string that begins with +jdbc:mysql://+ will
inform Sqoop that it should select the faster access method.

If your delimiters exactly match the delimiters used by +mysqldump+,
then Sqoop will use a fast-path that copies the data directly from
+mysqldump+'s output into HDFS. Otherwise, Sqoop will parse +mysqldump+'s
output into fields and transcode them into the user-specified delimiter set.
This incurs additional processing, so performance may suffer.
For convenience, the +--mysql-delimiters+
argument will set all the output delimiters to be consistent with
+mysqldump+'s format.
